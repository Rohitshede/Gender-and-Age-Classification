# Gender and Age Classification Project

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to develop accurate models for classifying gender and predicting age based on various input features. The project involves the following key components:

- Data Collection: Gathering dataset containing demographic information and images or other relevant features.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for training deep learning model.
- Model Training: Developing and training deep learning model using the prepared data.
- Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains 23,710 images. Each image is labeled as Age_Gender_Etnicity_Id.
